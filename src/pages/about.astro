  <h3>The Journey So Far</h3>
  <p>
    My quest began in the lands of Virginia, where I was lucky enough to stumble
    into the arcane arts of programming as a child. It came about, as all good
    things do, from the convergence of two tectonic plates in my life: <br /> my
    family's relative poverty and my love for video games.
  </p>
  <p>
    A crafty and mischievous 10 year old, I spent my nights leeching the dial up
    connection to fight the good fight in RuneScape (and eventually,
    Maplestory). And so did everyone else at school. <br />

    Also my father kept these bizarre stacks of colored squares, which I'd learn
    were called "Floppy Disks". They were wonderful--many even had little games
    on them. Pretty nifty! <br />

    The fission of said plates came when I realized I could write code to create
    on these silly squares... and, oh shit, I could sell them to my classmates.
    I quickly discovered what a gargantuan effort it was to make games, and
    failed to make anything I could convince my classmates to pay for. But boy
    oh boy could I write RuneScape bots. At 5-10c a disk, they were a hit.
    (Unfortunately, while I was a budding programmer, my business skills
    weren't' savvy enough to realize that this wasn't the financial genius I
    thought it would be originally. And it's a good thing, otherwise I may have
    never made them in the first place. I'm sure my parents thought it was cute
    that I was trying to help pay the bills with a handful of change from
    stealing their floppy disks.)
