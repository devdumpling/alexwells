  <h3>The Journey So Far</h3>
  <p>It began in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Southern Virginia.</p>
  <p>
    As a kid, I was lucky enough to stumble into programming, spurred by the
    grinding of two tectonic plates in my life:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>my family's relative poverty</li>
    <li>and my love for video games</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Like other nerdy kids in the late 90s/early 00s, I spent my nights fighting
    dial up to play on the internet (RuneScape and eventually, Maplestory and
    WoW).
  </p>

  <p>
    Around then, my dad introduced me to these bizarre stacks of colored
    squares, which I'd learn were called "Floppy Disks". They were
    wonderful--many even had little games on them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The fusion of said plates came when I learned I could write code to create
    on these silly squares
  </p>
  <p>...and, oh shit. I could sell them to my classmates.</p>
  <p>
    I quickly discovered what a gargantuan effort it was to make games, but boy
    oh boy could I write RuneScape bots. At 5-10c a disk, they were a hit.
    (Unfortunately, while I was a budding programmer, my business skills weren't
    savvy enough to realize that this wasn't the financial genius I thought it
    would be. And that's a good thing, otherwise I may have never made them in
    the first place.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite my best efforts, no chunk change was going to save my parents'
    marriage.
  </p>
  <p>However, this was enough to spark my curiosity and charter my course.</p>
  <p>
    From here I ventured to Oberlin College with a vague goal to study computer
    science. Fortunately, Oberlin (like many liberal arts colleges) was the
    perfect place for someone like me who had no clue what the fuck they were
    doing. In 2015, I narrowly earned my Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science. I
    say narrowly because I was an awful student. I'll spare you the typical
    coming-of-age details. Stories like this are a dime a dozen--feel free to
    fill in the gaps.
  </p>
  <p>
    Suffice it to say that my mediocre grades were a poor reflection of how much
    I learned. I wouldn't realize that until many years later, though.
  </p>
  <p>
    Apparently determined to continue the theme of general wanderlust, I
    followed the winds with close friends to Madison, WI. I came armed with 4
    years of deep and mostly useless experience repairing printers, laptops, and
    desktops, a gallery of side projects, games, and half-finished apps, the
    emotional undertow of a guttering and newly long distance relationship, a
    mild caffeine addiction, and my minted degree in theoretical problem
    solving.
  </p>
  <p>
    In other words, I was ready for a Real Midwestern existential crisis. (By
    the way, if you're looking for a place to have an existential crisis, look
    no further than the sub-zero, snow covered lakecity of Madison.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Eventually, I quit the lackluster IT job I worked upon arrival, ran out of
    money, and by the summer of '16 fled home for some soul searching. I spent
    that summer helping my family fix up my childhood home, intent to sell.
    There's a stereotype that returning home is a "bad thing", a uniquely
    western cultural faux pas. Growing up, I wanted nothing more than to be out
    of my hometown, far from the chaos of a broken family. The surreal
    blue-green gradient of the Blue Ridge Mountains was a noisy vignette in my
    rearview mirror.
  </p>
  <p>
    But on coming back? Holy shit. Imagine those mountains after living in the
    flat, unchanging midwest for 5 years.
  </p>
  <p>And so I began healing.</p>
  <p>
    After a summer of hard labor, I rekindled my love for programming, returned
    to Madison, and took a job as an instructor at a (bougie) tech summer camp.
    Therein I found an unexpected love for teaching. I remember thinking there
    was nothing as inspiring as the glow of a kid hacking their first game or
    website together. Maybe I saw myself in that glow.
  </p>
  <p>
    That propelled me into the next couple years working for a local non-profit
    where I taught girls and students of color programming, CS, and the like. It
    was patient, humbling work. The kind of work you could do quietly for the
    rest of your life.
  </p>
  <p>
    But eventually I got restless. I also met my wife-to-be and promptly fell in
    love (it was at a vegan pizza party/animal activism event).
  </p>
  <p>
    Hungry for more (or different), we moved to Columbus, OH. My wife's family
    lived there, and I landed a good job as a software engineer at a massive
    energy enterprise.
  </p>
  <p>
    The work was boring, but it gave me exposure to hairy, complex software at
    scale.
